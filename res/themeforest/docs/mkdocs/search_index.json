Each page can only uses the JavaScript it needs and nothing more.\n\n\nAll javascript source files are under \nsrc/js/\n folder:\n\n\n  src/js/\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 angular/\n  \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 app.js (angular app)\n  \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 router.js (angular router)\n  \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ui/\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 apps/ (app initialize function extend from site initialize)\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 components/ (components data api)\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 configs/ (js config file)\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 plugins/ (template plugins)\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 sections/ (site section script, such as: nav, sidebar...)\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 site.js (site initialize function)\n  \u2514\u2500\u2500 core.js (define root object $.site and $.components)\n\n\n\nAll minified and combined files are under \nassets/js/\n folder.\n\n\n4.2 Data API\n\n\nWe appreciate \ndata-api\n syntax defined by \nBootstrap\n. It's a modualr way to organize the initialize script for the 3rd plugin.\n\n\nRegister\n\n\nWe use the function below to register data-api:\n\n\n$.components.register(name, obj);\n\n\n\nThe \nobj\n is defined \ndata-api\n mode and plugin initialize function. There are three modes in Remark template:\n\n\n\n\napi\n: will use \ndataAPI{plugin name}\n function and not need to be re-initialized when new elements added in \ndocument\n.\n\n\ndefault\n: will use \ndefault initialize function\n.\n\n\ninit\n: will use \ninit{plugin name}\n function and need to be re-initialized when new elements added in \ndocument\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe card  \nobj\n example:\n\n\n/*src/js/components/card.js*/\n$.components.register(\"card\", {\n  mode: \"init\",\n  init: function(context) {\n    if (!$.fn.card) return;\n    var defaults = $.components.getDefaults(\"card\");\n\n    $('[data-plugin=\"card\"]', context).each(function() {\n      var options = $.extend({}, defaults, $(this).data());\n\n      if (options.target) {\n        options.container = $(options.target);\n      }\n      $(this).card(options);\n    });\n  }\n});\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nJust like \nBootstrap\n \ndata-api\n usage, add data-plugin=\"{plugin name}\" to element and add [data-{options}] to element. The plugin will be initialized. You can also manually initialize the \ndata-api\n whose type is \ndefault\n or \ninit\n:\n\n\n$.components.get('multiSelect').init();\n\n\n\n4.3 Options\n\n\nWe define the \ndefault options\n for 3rd plugin by default property in each components' object. You can modify the \ndefault\n property to suit your use case.\nWhen you manually initialize plugin, you can get the defaults options:\n\n\nvar defaults = $.components.getDefaults('{plugin name}');\n\n\n\n4.4 Javascript Initialization\n\n\nSite core javascript initialization implemented in \nsrc/js/site.js'\n.\n\n\nRun the code below:\n\n\n$(document).ready(function(){\n  Site.run();\n});\n\n\n\nIt will initialize the registed \ndata-api\n and initialize site structure script. Maybe you need more customize initialization script, you can refer to the following example:\n\n\nvar MyApp = Site.extend({\n  customFunction : function(){\n      ....\n  },\n\n  run: function(next) {\n    this.customFunction();\n\n    next();//queue next run function\n  }\n});\n\nMyApp.run();",

Register  We use the function below to register data-api:  $.components.register(name, obj);  The  obj  is defined  data-api  mode and plugin initialize function. There are three modes in Remark template:   api : will use  dataAPI{plugin name}  function and not need to be re-initialized when new elements added in  document .  default : will use  default initialize function .  init : will use  init{plugin name}  function and need to be re-initialized when new elements added in  document .   The card   obj  example:  /*src/js/components/card.js*/\n$.components.register(\"card\", {\n  mode: \"init\",\n  init: function(context) {\n    if (!$.fn.card) return;\n    var defaults = $.components.getDefaults(\"card\");\n\n    $('[data-plugin=\"card\"]', context).each(function() {\n      var options = $.extend({}, defaults, $(this).data());\n\n      if (options.target) {\n        options.container = $(options.target);\n      }\n      $(this).card(options);\n    });\n  }\n});  Usage  Just like  Bootstrap   data-api  usage, add data-plugin=\"{plugin name}\" to element and add [data-{options}] to element. The plugin will be initialized. You can also manually initialize the  data-api  whose type is  default  or  init :  $.components.get('multiSelect').init();",
